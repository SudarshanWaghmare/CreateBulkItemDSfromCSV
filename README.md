This is an ITK utility written in C++ for automating the creation of bulk Items and Datasets in Teamcenter, using data from a CSV file. Below is an overview and key details about the functionality and APIs used in the code:

**Overview of the ITK Utility**
This ITK utility facilitates:

Bulk Creation of Items: Automatically generates Items and their Revisions based on CSV input.
Dataset Creation and Association: Creates and associates Datasets (PDF and DOCX) with the Items using GRM relationships.
Property Setting: Assigns properties to Items, Item Revisions, and Datasets.
Error Logging and Reporting: Produces reports in text and CSV formats for tracking created Items.
Project and Ownership Management: Assigns Items to projects and updates ownership when required.
File Importing: Imports files into created Datasets (e.g., PDFs and DOCX documents).
Key APIs Used
Login and Initialization:

ITK_init_module(userID, password, group): Logs into Teamcenter with specified credentials.
Item and Revision Management:

TCTYPE_ask_type(): Finds the Item type.
TCTYPE_construct_create_input(): Prepares the input structure for object creation.
TCTYPE_create_object(): Creates Items and Datasets.
ITEM_ask_latest_rev(): Retrieves the latest revision of an Item.
AOM_lock() / AOM_unlock(): Locks and unlocks objects for modification.
AOM_set_value_*(): Sets string, logical, and numeric properties for Items and Revisions.
Dataset Management:

DATASET_create(): Creates a Dataset.
AE_import_named_ref(): Imports files into Datasets.
AOM_save_with_extensions(): Saves the created objects.
GRM Relationship Management:

**GRM_find_relation_type():** Finds the type of relationship (e.g., IMAN_specification).
GRM_create_relation(): Establishes GRM relationships between Items and Datasets.
Folder and Project Management:

SA_find_user2(): Finds a user based on the userID.
SA_ask_user_home_folder(): Retrieves the user's home folder.
FL_insert(): Places an object in a folder.
PROJ_find(): Finds a project by name.
PROJ_assign_objects(): Assigns Items to a project.
File Handling and Reports:

Standard C file I/O functions like fopen(), fgets(), and fputs() to handle CSV reading and report generation.
Additional Highlights
Error Handling: Status codes are checked after each ITK call, ensuring robust error detection and handling.
Dynamic Property Handling: Various properties are dynamically assigned based on CSV content, allowing flexibility for different use cases.
Utility Completion Logs: Tracks the total number of created Items and provides detailed logs for verification.
Enhancements in the Utility
CSV Input Handling: Automatically parses and validates input from a CSV file.
GRM Relationship Customization: Supports adding multiple relationships, such as IMAN_specification and IMAN_reference.
Comprehensive Reports: Generates both text and CSV reports for auditing created Items.
